# CORS

Many modern browsers follow _securty policies_ that prevent downloading resources from other web servers to miticate security risks.

## What is a security policy?

First policy to discuss is _same-origin security policy_. It states that from a webpage you can navigate urls to web pages of the same _origin_ - meaning the same protocol, same host and port. This policy is too restrictive, so there's another one: _cross-origin security policy_ that evolved into _cross-origin resource sharing_ or CORS.
