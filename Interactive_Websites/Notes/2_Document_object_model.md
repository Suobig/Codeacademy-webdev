# Document Object Model (DOM)

## What is DOM

 DOM is a tree-like structure that allows users to conceptualize hierarchy and access the lemenets on a web page.

## The DOM as Tree Structure

DOM tree consists of _nodes_. A node is an intersecting point in a tree that contains data.

The top-most node is called _root node_.

## Parent Child Relationships in the DOM

A _parent node_ is the closest connected node to another node in the direction towards the root.

A _child node_ is the closest connected node to another node in the direction away from the root.

## Nodes and ELements in the DOM

There are 9 different types of node objects in the DOM. On diagrams `Elements` are usually displayed as sharp-edged nodes, while `Text` is displayed in round-edged rectangles.

## Attributes of Element Node

DOM allows us to access node's attributes, such as its `class`, `id` and `style`.
