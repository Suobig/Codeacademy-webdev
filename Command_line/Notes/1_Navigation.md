The _command line_ is a text interface for othe computer's operating system.

## `ls`

`ls` shows a list of current folder (called _directories_) and files in current directory.

## Filesystem

Filesystem is organized into a tree structure:

1. The first directory in the filesystem is called _root directory_
2. Each parent directory can contain more directories and files
3. Each directory can contain more files and child directories

## `pwd`

`pwd` stands for "print working directory". _working directory_ is the directory terminal is currently in

## `cd`

## `mkdir`

`mkdir` stands for "make directory". It takes a directory name as an argument and creates a new directory in the current working directory.

## `touch`

`touch` command creates a new file inside the working directory. It takes filename as an argument and then creates an empty file.
