# How to Buld a (Web Dev) Portfolio

## Why have a portofio

1. Perpsective employers need to see your work
2. Brings credability
3. It's an online resume

## Where to start

1. Codeacademy Projects.
2. Build a project on your own (probably update someone's else website).
3. Keep builing (2-3 owned projects is a good start). Update your existing projects.
4. Clean up (remove old projects or ones you don't want to show).

## Where to host

1. Web hosting (low performance, limited tech support);
2. VPS (higher performance, requires setting up the server);
3. Dedicated (higher cost, high level of deployment knowledge).

Good idea is to use GitHub for hosting code.
