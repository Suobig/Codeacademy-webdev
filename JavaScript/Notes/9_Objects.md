# Objects

## Object Literals

We use `{}` to create object literals.

Data in an object is unordered.

Data in object is organazied into _key-value pairs_.

A key's value can be of any type, including functions or other objects.

Key names (_identifiers_) are strings.

if an identifier has no special symbols (like space characters), we can ommit quotation marks.
