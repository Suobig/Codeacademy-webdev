# Objects

## Object Literals

We use `{}` to create object literals.

Data in an object is unordered.

Data in object is organazied into _key-value pairs_.

A key's value can be of any type, including functions or other objects.

Key names (_identifiers_) are strings.

if an identifier has no special symbols (like space characters), we can ommit quotation marks.

## Assigning Properties

If we try to access a property that wasn't assigned, we'll get `undefined`.

## Bracket Notation

We _must_ use bracket notation when accessing properties that has spaces, special characters in them or start with numbers.

## Property Assignment

Objects are mutable. If we assign a new property, it will be created.

## Methods

When data as stored as a function, we call it _method_.

## Nested Objects

We can put objects inside objects.

## Pass By Reference

Objects are passed by reference. We can change proprties, but we can't reassign objects (it won't return an error, but it won't reassign either).

## Looping Through Objects

We can use `for ... in ...` to iterate the object by property names.
