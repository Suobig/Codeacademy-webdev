# Arrays

Arrays are JS's way to create lists.

Arrays can store any data types.

## Create An Array

Arrays are created as a comma separataed list of elements within square brackets.

## Accessing Elements

We can access elements by index (starting with 0).

## Update Elements

JS arrays are mutable.

## Arrays with let and const

Declaring array as a const variable won't stop you from reassigning its elements.

## The .length property

`.length` is used to calculate the size of an array.

## The push() method

The `push()` method is used to add elements to the end of an array. We can add as many items as we like, separating them by comma.

## The pop() method

The `pop()` method removes the last element from an array and returns it.

## More array methods

Some other array methods are:

* `join()`
* `slice()`
* `splice()`
* `shift()` - remove the first element from the list
* `unshift()` - add an element to the beginning of the list
* `concat()`
* `indexOf()`

## Arrays and Functions

If we pass an array to a function, the function can mutate it.

## Nested Arrays

Arrays can be elements of arrays.
