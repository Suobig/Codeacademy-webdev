# Higher-Order Functions

Higher-Order Functions are functions that take other functions as an input and/or return functions as output.

## Functions as Data

In JS functions are _first class objects_ meaning they can have properties and methods like other objects.

We can treat functions as any other type of data.

## Functions as Parameters

We can pass a function as a parameter to other function.
