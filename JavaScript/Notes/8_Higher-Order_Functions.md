# Higher-Order Functions

Higher-Order Functions are functions that take other functions as an input and/or return functions as output.

## Functions as Data

In JS functions are _first class objects_ meaning they can have properties and methods like other objects.

We can treat functions as any other type of data.

## Functions as Parameters

We can pass a function as a parameter to other function.

## Iterators

The built-in JavaScript array methods that can iterate are called _iteration methods_ or _iterators_.

### The .forEach() Method

Always returns `undefined`.

### The .map() Method

Returns a new array.

### The .filter() Method

Returns a new array.

### The .findIndex() Method

Returns index of a first element that evaluates to `true` in a callback function.

### The .reduce() Method

Takes a callback function and a starting value for an accumulator. Callback function takes accumulator and current value as arguments and returns new accumulator value. `.reduce()` return final accumulator value.
