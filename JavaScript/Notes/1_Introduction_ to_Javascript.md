# Introduction to JavaScript

## What is JavaScript

JavaScript is prmarily known as the language of most modern web browsers.

## Console

Developers use console to display important messages, errors etc.

To display console use `console.log('message');`

## Comments

You can leave commments in JS. The browser will ignore this code.

There're 2 different types of code comments:

1. _Single line comment_ denoted with `//` You can use this at the beginning or at the end of the line.
2. _Multi-line comment_ denoted with `/*` and `*/`. You can use this even in the middle of the line.

## Data Types

JS has 7 fundamental data types:

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined
6. Symbol
7. Object

Types 1-6 are considered _primitive_ data types.

## Arithmetic Operators

There're 5 arithmetic operators:

1. add: `+`
2. substract: `-`
3. multiply: `*`
4. divide: `/`
5. remainder (or _modulo_): `%`

## String concatenation

You can use `+` with strings to add them together. This process is called _concatenation_.

## Properties

Every string has a property `length`

## Methods

Methods are being _called_ or used with parenthesis `()` at the end.

Here are some `String` methods:

* `toUpperCase()` - capitalize all leteres;
* `startsWith()` - gets first letter;
* `trim()` - removes whitespaces in the start and end of a string.

## Built-in Objects

In addition to `console` there're other objects that are built into JS. One of them is `Math` with methods like `random()`, `floor()` etc.
