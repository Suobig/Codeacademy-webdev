# Scope

## Blocks and Scope

A _block_ is the code inside `{}`.

## Global Scope

In _global scope_ variables are declared outside of blocks. These variable are called _global variables_. Those variables can be accessed anywhere in the program.

## Block Scope

Variable declared within a block have _block scope_ if they only can be accessed within that block.

## Scope Pollution

_Scope pollution_ is when we have too many global variables that exist in the global namespace or when we reuse variables across different scopes.

## Practice Good Scoping

Varibles should be scoped as tightly as possible.
