# Functions

## What is function

_Function_ is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.

## Function declaration

There're many way to use functions. One way is _function declaration_. It's done by using `function` keyword, followed by an _identifier_ followed by parentheses, and then function body in curly brackets `{ }`.

We should be aware of a _hoisting_ feature in JS that allows function declarations be awailable before they're defined.

## Calling a function

The code inside function's body is only executed when the function is _called_.

## Parameters and Arguments

When declaring a function, we can specify it's _parameters_.

When calling a function, we can pass values that are called _arguments_.

## Deafult Parameters

If there's no argument passed, a parameter is set to `undefined`.

But we can set a default value.

## Return

By default, function returns `undefined`.

## Helper Functions

When function is being called within another function, it's usually called _helper function_.

## Function Expressions

Function expression is being built like a variable, but instead of assigning it a value we assing _anonymous_ function.

Function expressions are not hoisted.

## Arrow functions

We can call arrow functions by using _fat arrow notation_ `() =>`

## Concise Body Arrow Functions

If a function takes 1 parameter, parentheses can be ommited. If a function body has only a return statement, curly brackets and `return` can be both ommited.
