# HTTP requests

Web pages are generated by HTTP and CSS, sent to a final user via internet. The internet is made up of a much of resourses hosted on different servers. To access this content a web browser must ask these servers for the resources it wants.

## What is HTTP

HTTP stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol" and is used tos tructure requests and responses over the internet.

The transfer of resources is controlled using TCP (Transimission Control Protocol). TCP manages the channels between a browser and a server.

## HTTP and TCP: How it Works

When you type an address, you're commanding your browser to open a TCP channel to the server that responds to that URL (or Uniform Resource Locator).

Once TCP connection is established, the clients sends a HTTP _GET_ request to the server to retrieve the webpage it should display. After the server has sent the response, it closes TCP connection.
